## News ðŸ’£
We have the pleasure to host two webinars from international experts in the generative deep learning research field!

We will host **[Chitwan Saharia](https://chitwansaharia.github.io/)** from Google Brain and **[Yang Song](https://yang-song.github.io/)** from Stanford AI Lab!

## About the course :dart:

This course covers the foundations and the main models of generative deep learning, including autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, flow-based models and energy-based models.

#### Program at a glance :page_with_curl:

* **INTRODUCTION TO GENERATIVE DEEP LEARNING.** Generative modeling and probabilistic generative models. Deep neural networks. Building deep network models. Learning latent representations.
* **GENERATIVE AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS.** Autoregressive models. Parameterization by neural networks. Generation examples.
* **VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODERS.** Probabilistic principal component analysis. Variational inference. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) and modern deep VAE architectures.
* **GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS.** Generator and critic. Training generative adversarial networks (GANs). Optimization and loss functions of GANs.
* **ENERGY-BASED AND DIFFUSION MODELS.** Likelihood based learning. Energy based models (EBMs) with latent variables. Self-supervised learning with EBMs. Diffusion and score-based models.
* **APPLICATIONS.** Python examples of generative deep learning models, including: music generation, image style transfer, text generation, video generation, anomaly detection, data augmentation, inverse problems solution and medical imaging applications, among others.
* **SEMINARS.**
